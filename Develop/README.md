### Project Description:
A key component of your profile, and one that many new developers overlook, is the README file that's associated with each respository. A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repositoryâ€”it's the first thing that a person sees when they visit a repo on GitHub. But it's also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo's project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.

### Installation guide: 
provides an alternative to writing in word processors like Microsoft Word or Pages. These editors provide a ton of options for formatting your text, but those can waste time if you have to wade through menus just to find the bulleted list or header option

### Usability:
get-readme, follow the sequence of questions 

### Collaborations:
